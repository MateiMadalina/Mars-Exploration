# Mars Exploration 

## Project Description 
The 'Mars Exploration' Java project is an application used to simulate exploration on three Mars maps. The spaceship lands on one of the three maps. After landing, the rover is deployed, and it searches for resources. The primary goal is to locate essential resources required for human survival, to determine if the planet can be colonized or not. If the rover decides that the planet can be colonized after researching the resources, the extraction process will begin. Once a sufficient amount of resources is collected, the construction of a command center is initiated. After that, the rover will collect resources again so that the construction of other rovers can begin. The process repeats until each resource near the command center has a rover built and assigned to extract that resource.

### Technologies Used
- Java - This application was entirely made using Java programming language;

### Challenges
- Working with coordinates;
- Rover movement and scan logic.
- Designing routines and timing of new rover building and deployment in conjunction with material extraction.

### Setup
- Just clone the project and simply press the "Run Application.java" button.

### How to Use
After the run button has been pressed, the following information will be displayed in the console:
